## 📌 Vision

**CodeNarrator** aims to bridge the gap between complex code and developer understanding. Whether you're a beginner exploring a new open-source repo, a maintainer reviewing a PR, or an engineer returning to your own spaghetti code — CodeNarrator helps you understand any codebase faster, smarter, and with less frustration.

We believe **every developer deserves a code buddy** that makes codebases readable and approachable — instantly.
